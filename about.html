        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Don't Quit Cafe started as Don't Quit Coffee, a small roadside stall run by three friends who shared a love
          for coffee. With nothing but a simple setup and a passion for brewing, we focused on serving freshly made
          coffee to anyone who needed a good cup to start their day. At first, it was just about coffee, but as more
          people discovered us, we saw an opportunity to grow.

          After some time, we finally had the chance to move into a proper space. With a bigger place came new
          possibilities. We started adding more to our menu, from pastries to light meals, offering more than just
          coffee but a complete experience for our customers. What began as a simple coffee stall slowly transformed
          into something more. That was when we decided to evolve from Don't Quit Coffee into Don't Quit Cafe.

          Despite all the changes, one thing has always stayed the same. Our commitment to serving quality drinks and
          creating a warm, inviting space for everyone. Don't Quit Cafe is more than just a coffee shop. It is a place
          where people can take a break, enjoy good food, and be reminded that no matter how tough the journey gets, you
          should never give up on your dreams.
